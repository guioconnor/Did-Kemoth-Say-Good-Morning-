== What is it?

This is a quick and dirty script that queries the twitter search API to check if user @kemoth has already said "Bom dia vermes" (Good morning, worms), a
a phrase with which he greets his fellow twitters every day.

The script will check against tweets matching the text pattern and will filter out the ones published before the current day, according to timezone America/Sao_Paulo.
The script will then generate a page intending to answer the question: "Has @Kemoth already said 'good morning worms'".
